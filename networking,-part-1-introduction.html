            <h3>Networking, Part 1: Introduction</h3>

<p>Caveat: It should be obvious that  page is <em>not</em> a complete description of IP, UDP or TCP! Instead it is a short introduction and is sufficient so that we can build upon these concepts in later lectures.</p>
<h2>What is "IP4" "IP6"?</h2>
<p>The following is the "30 second" introduction to internet protocol (IP) - which is the primary way to send packets ("datagrams") of information from one machine to another.</p>
<p>"IP4", or more precisely, "IPv4" is version 4 of the Internet Protocol that describes how to send packets of information across a network from one machine to another . Roughly 95% of all packets on the Internet today are IPv4 packets. A significant limitation of IPv4 is that source and destination addresses are limited to 32 bits (IPv4 was designed at a time when the idea of 4 billion devices connected to the same network was unthinkable - or at least not worth making the packet size larger) </p>
<p>Each IPv4 packet includes a very small header - typically 20 bytes (more precisely, "octets"), that includes a source and destination address.</p>
<p>Conceptually the source and destination addresses can be split into two: a network number (the upper bits) and the lower bits represent a particular host number on that network.</p>
<p>A newer packet protocol "IPv6" solves many of the limitations of IPv4 (e.g. makes routing tables simpler and 128 bit addresses) however less than 5% of web traffic is IPv6 based.</p>
<p>A machine can have an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address.</p>
<h2>"There's no place like 127.0.0.1"!</h2>
<p>A special IPv4 address is <code>127.0.0.1</code> also known as localhost. Packets sent to 127.0.0.1 will never leave the machine; the address is specified to be the same machine.</p>
<p>Notice that the 32 bits address is split into 4 octets i.e. each number in the dot notation can be 0-255 inclusive. However IPv4 addresses can also be written as an integer.</p>
<h2>... and ... "There's no place like 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1?"</h2>
<p>The 128bit localhost address in IPv6 is <code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</code> which can be written in its shortened form, <code>::1</code></p>
<h2>What is a port?</h2>
<p>To send a datagram (packet) to a host on the Internet using IPv4 (or IPv6) you need to specify the host address and a port. The port is an unsigned 16 bit number (i.e. the maximum port number is 65535).</p>
<p>A process can listen for incoming packets on a particular port. However only processes with super-user (root) access can listen on ports &lt; 1024. Any process can listen on ports 1024 or higher.</p>
<p>An often used port is port 80: Port 80 is used for unencrypted http requests (i.e. web pages).<br />
For example, if a web browser connects to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">http://www.bbc.com/</a>, then it will be connecting to port 80.</p>
<h2>What is UDP? When is it used?</h2>
<p>UDP is a connectionless protocol that is built on top of IPv4 and IPv6. It's very simple to use: Decide the destination address and port and send your data packet! However the network makes no guarantee about whether the packets will arrive.<br />
Packets (aka Datagrams) may be dropped if the network is congested. Packets may be duplicated or arrive out of order.</p>
<p>Between two distant data-centers it's typical to see 3% packet loss.</p>
<p>A typical use case for UDP is when receiving up to date data is more important than receiving all of the data. For example, a game may send continuous updates of player positions. A streaming video signal may send picture updates using UDP</p>
<h2>What is TCP? When is it used?</h2>
<p>TCP is a connection-based protocol that is built on top of IPv4 and IPv6 (and therefore can be described as "TCP/IP" or "TCP over IP"). TCP creates a <em>pipe</em> between two machines and abstracts away the low level packet-nature of the Internet: Thus, under most conditions, bytes sent from one machine will eventually arrive at the other end without duplication or data loss. </p>
<p>TCP will automatically manage resending packets, ignoring duplicate packets, re-arranging out-of-order packets and changing the rate at which packets are sent.</p>
<p>TCP's three way handshake is known as SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. The diagram on this page helps with understanding the TCP handshake. <a href="http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml">TCP Handshake</a></p>
<p>Most services on the Internet today (e.g. a web service) use TCP because it hides the complexity of lower, packet-level nature of the Internet.</p>          </div>
