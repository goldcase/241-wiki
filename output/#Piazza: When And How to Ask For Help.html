<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>TAs and student assistants get a ton of questions. Some are well-researched, and some...are not. This is a handy guide that'll help you move away from the latter and towards the former. (Oh, and did I mention that this is an easy way to score points with your internship managers?)</p>
<h3>Ask yourself...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Am I running on EWS?</li>
<li><strong>Did I check the man pages?</strong></li>
<li>Have I searched for similar questions/followups on Piazza?</li>
<li>Have I read the MP/DS specification completely?</li>
<li>Have I watched all of the videos?</li>
<li><strong>Did I Google the error message</strong> (and a few permutations thereof if necessary)?</li>
<li>Did I try commenting out, printlining, and/or stepping through parts of the code bit by bit to find out precisely where the error occurs?</li>
<li><strong>Did I commit my code to SVN in case the TAs need more context?</strong></li>
<li>Did I include the console/GDB/Valgrind output <strong>AND</strong> code surrounding the bug in my Piazza post?</li>
<li>Have I fixed other segmentation faults not related to the issue I'm having?</li>
<li>Am I following good programming practice? (i.e. encapsulation, functions to limit repetition, etc)</li>
</ul>
