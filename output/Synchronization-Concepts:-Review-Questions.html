<em> Hold and wait<br />
</em> Circular wait<br />
<em> No pre-emption<br />
</em> Mutual exclusion</p>
<h2>Q2</h2>

Hold and wait<br />
Circular wait<br />
No pre-emption<br />
Mutual exclusion</p>
<h2>Q3</h2>
<p>Identify when Dining Philosophers code causes a deadlock (or not). For example, if you saw the following code snippet which Coffman condition is not satisfied?</p>
<p>// Get both locks or none.<br />
pthread_mutex_lock( a );<br />
if( pthread_mutex_trylock( b ) ) { /<em>failed</em>/<br />
   pthread_mutex_unlock( a );<br />
   ...<br />
}</p>
<h2>Q4</h2>
<p>How many processes are blocked?</p>
<p>P1 acquires R1<br />
P2 acquires R2<br />
P1 acquires R3<br />
P2 waits for R3<br />
P3 acquires R5<br />
P1 acquires for R4<br />
P3 waits for R1<br />
P4 waits for R5<br />
P5 waits for R1</p>
<h2>Q5</h2>
<p>How many of the following statements are true for the reader-writer problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be multiple active readers</li>
