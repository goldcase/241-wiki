<h2>Use <code>cat</code> as your IDE</h2>
<p>Who needs an editor? IDE? We can just use <code>cat</code>!<br />
You've seen <code>cat</code> being used to read the contents of files but it can also be used to read the  standard-input and send it back to standard output.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat
HELLO
HELLO
</pre></div>


<p>To finish reading from the input stream close the input stream by pressing <code>CTRL-D</code></p>
<p>Let's use <code>cat</code> to send standard input to a file. We will use '&gt;' to redirect its output to a file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat &gt; myprog.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {printf(&quot;Hi!&quot;);return 0;}
</pre></div>


<p>(Be careful! Deletes and undos are not allowed...)<br />
Press <code>CTRL-D</code> when finished.</p>
<h2>Edit your code with <code>perl</code> regular expressions (aka "remember your perl pie")</h2>
<p>A useful trick if you have several text files (e.g. source code) to change is to use regular expressions.<br />
<code>perl</code> makes this very easy to edit files in place.<br />
Just remember 'perl pie' and search on the web...</p>
<p>An example. Suppose we want to change the sequence "Hi" to "Bye" in all .c files in the current directory. Then we can write a simple substitution pattern that will be executed on each line at time in all files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ perl -p -i -e &#39;s/Hi/Bye/&#39; *.c
</pre></div>


<p>(Don't panic if you get it wrong, original files are still there; they just have the extension .bak)<br />
Obviously there's a lot more you can do with regular expressions than changing Hi to Bye.</p>
<h2>Use your shell <code>!!</code></h2>
<p>To re-run the last command just type <code>!!</code> and press <code>return</code><br />
To re-run the last command that started with g type <code>!g</code>  and press <code>return</code></p>
<h2>Use your shell <code>&amp;&amp;</code></h2>
<p>Tired of running <code>make</code> or <code>gcc</code> and then running the program if it compiled OK? Instead, use &amp;&amp; to chain these commands together</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ gcc program.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out
</pre></div>


<h2>Make can do more than make</h2>
<p>You might also try putting a line in your Makefile that will compile, and then run your program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>run : $(program)
        ./$(program)
</pre></div>


<p>Then running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ make run
</pre></div>


<p>will make sure any changes you've made are compiled, and run your program in one go. Also good for testing many inputs at once. Although you probably would just rather write a regular shell script for that.</p>
<h2>Is your neighbor too productive? C pre-procesors to the rescue!</h2>
<p>Use the C pre-processor to redefine common keywords e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#define if while</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Protip: Put this line inside one of the standard includes e.g. /usr/include/stdio.h</p>
<h2>Who needs functions when you C have the preprocessor</h2>
<p>OK, so this is more of a gotcha. Be careful when using macros that look like functions...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#define min(a,b) a&lt;b?a:b</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A perfectly reasonable definition of a minimum of a and b. However the pre-processor is just a simple<br />
text wrangler so precedence can bite you:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Should be -2?</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Is expanded to </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>int value = -2&lt;3 ? 2 :3; // Ooops.. result will be 2
</pre></div>


<p>A partial fix is to wrap every argument with <code>()</code> and also the whole expression with ():</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#define min(a,b) (  (a) &lt; (b) ?(a):(b) )</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However this is still <em>not</em> a function! For example can you see why <code>min(i++,10)</code> might increment i once or twice!?</p>
