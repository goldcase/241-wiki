            <h3>Nonblocking I O, select(), and epoll</h3>

<h3>Don't waste time waiting</h3>
<p>Normally, when you call <code>read()</code>, if the data is not available yet it will wait until the data is ready before the function returns.  When you're reading data from a disk, that delay may not be long, but when you're reading from a slow network connection it may take a long time for that data to arrive, if it ever arrives.  </p>
<p>POSIX lets you set a flag on a file descriptor such that any call to <code>read()</code> on that file descriptor will return immediately, whether it has finished or not.  With your file descriptor in this mode, your call to <code>read()</code> will start<br />
the read operation, and while it's working you can do other useful work.  This is called "nonblocking" mode,<br />
since the call to <code>read()</code> doesn't block.</p>
<p>To set a file descriptor to be nonblocking:</p>
<pre><code>// fd is my file descriptor
int flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0);
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
</code></pre>
<p>For a socket, you can create it in nonblocking mode by adding <code>SOCK_NONBLOCK</code> to the second argument to <code>socket()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM | SOCK_NONBLOCK, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>When a file is in nonblocking mode and you call <code>read()</code>, it will return immediately with whatever bytes are available.<br />
Say 100 bytes have arrived from the server at the other end of your socket and you call <code>read(fd, buf, 150)</code>.<br />
Read will return immediately with a value of 100, meaning it read 100 of the 150 bytes you asked for.<br />
Say you tried to read the remaining data with a call to <code>read(fd, buf+100, 50)</code>, but the last 50 bytes still hadn't<br />
arrived yet.  <code>read()</code> would return -1 and set the global error variable <strong>errno</strong> to either<br />
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.  That's the system's way of telling you the data isn't ready yet.</p>
<p><code>write()</code> also works in nonblocking mode.  Say you want to send 40,000 bytes to a remote server using a socket.<br />
The system can only send so many bytes at a time. Common systems can send about 23,000 bytes at a time. In nonblocking mode, <code>write(fd, buf, 40000)</code> would return the number of bytes it was able to<br />
send immediately, or about 23,000.  If you called <code>write()</code> right away again, it would return -1 and set errno to<br />
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK. That's the system's way of telling you it's still busy sending the last chunk of data,<br />
and isn't ready to send more yet.</p>
<h3>How do I check when the I/O has finished?</h3>
<p>There are a few ways.  Let's see how to do it using <em>select</em> and <em>epoll</em>.</p>
<h4>select</h4>
<pre><code>int select(int nfds, 
           fd_set *readfds, 
           fd_set *writefds,
           fd_set *exceptfds, 
           struct timeval *timeout);
</code></pre>
<p>Given three sets of file descriptors, <code>select()</code> will wait for any of those file descriptors to become 'ready'.<br />
<em> readfds - a file descriptor in readfds is ready when there is data that can be read or EOF has been reached.<br />
</em> writefds - a file descriptor in writefds is ready when a call to write() will succeed.<br />
* exceptfds - system-specific, not well-defined.  Just pass NULL for this.</p>
<p><code>select()</code> returns the total number of file descriptors that are ready.  If none of them become<br />
ready during the time defined by <em>timeout</em>, it will return 0.  After <code>select()</code> returns, the <br />
caller will need to loop<br />
through the file descriptors in readfds and/or writefds to see which ones are ready.</p>
<pre><code>fd_set readfds, writefds;
FD_ZERO(&amp;amp;readfds);
FD_ZERO(&amp;amp;writefds);
for (int i=0; i &amp;lt; read_fd_count; i++)
  FD_SET(my_read_fds[i], &amp;amp;readfds);
for (int i=0; i &amp;lt; write_fd_count; i++)
  FD_SET(my_write_fds[i], &amp;amp;writefds);

struct timeval timeout;
timeout.tv_sec = 3;
timeout.tv_usec = 0;

int num_ready = select(FD_SETSIZE, &amp;amp;readfds, &amp;amp;writefds, NULL, &amp;amp;timeout);

if (num_ready &amp;lt; 0) {
  perror("error in select()");
} else if (num_ready == 0) {
  printf("timeout\n");
} else {
  for (int i=0; i &amp;lt; read_fd_count; i++)
    if (FD_ISSET(my_read_fds[i], &amp;amp;readfds))
      printf("fd %d is ready for reading\n", my_read_fds[i]);
  for (int i=0; i &amp;lt; write_fd_count; i++)
    if (FD_ISSET(my_write_fds[i], &amp;amp;writefds))
      printf("fd %d is ready for writing\n", my_write_fds[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<h4>epoll</h4>
<p><em>epoll</em> is not part of POSIX, but it is supported by Linux.  It is a more efficient way to wait for many<br />
file descriptors.  It will tell you exactly which descriptors are ready. It even gives you a way to store<br />
a small amount of data with each descriptor, like an array index or a pointer, making it easier to access<br />
your data associated with that descriptor.</p>
<p>To use epoll, first you must create a special file descriptor with <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/epoll_create">epoll_create()</a>.  You won't read or write to this file<br />
descriptor; you'll just pass it to the other epoll_xxx functions and call<br />
close() on it at the end.</p>
<pre><code>epfd = epoll_create(1);
</code></pre>
<p>For each file descriptor you want to monitor with epoll, you'll need to add it <br />
to the epoll data structures <br />
using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/epoll_ctl">epoll_ctl()</a> with the <code>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</code> option.  You can add any<br />
number of file descriptors to it.</p>
<pre><code>struct epoll_event event;
event.events = EPOLLOUT;  // EPOLLIN==read, EPOLLOUT==write
event.data.ptr = mypointer;
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, mypointer-&amp;gt;fd, &amp;amp;event)
</code></pre>
<p>To wait for some of the file descriptors to become ready, use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/epoll_wait">epoll_wait()</a>.<br />
The epoll_event struct that it fills out will contain the data you provided in event.data when you<br />
added this file descriptor. This makes it easy for you to look up your own data associated<br />
with this file descriptor.</p>
<pre><code>int num_ready = epoll_wait(epfd, &amp;amp;event, 1, timeout_milliseconds);
if (num_ready &amp;gt; 0) {
  MyData *mypointer = (MyData*) event.data.ptr;
  printf("ready to write on %d\n", mypointer-&amp;gt;fd);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Say you were waiting to write data to a file descriptor, but now you want to wait to read data from it.<br />
Just use <code>epoll_ctl()</code> with the <code>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</code> option to change the type of operation you're monitoring.</p>
<pre><code>event.events = EPOLLOUT;
event.data.ptr = mypointer;
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, mypointer-&amp;gt;fd, &amp;amp;event);
</code></pre>
<p>To unsubscribe one file descriptor from epoll while leaving others active, use <code>epoll_ctl()</code> with the <code>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</code> option.</p>
<pre><code>epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, mypointer-&amp;gt;fd, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>To shut down an epoll instance, close its file descriptor.</p>
<pre><code>close(epfd);
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to nonblocking <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>, any calls to <code>connect()</code> on a nonblocking socket will also be<br />
nonblocking. To wait for the connection to complete, use <code>select()</code> or epoll to wait for the socket to be writable.</p>          </div>
