<p>Will  <code>write(fd, data, 5000)</code>  always send 5000 bytes of data? When can it fail?</p>
<h1>Coding questions</h1>
<h2>Q 2.1</h2>
<p>Writing to a network socket may not send all of the bytes and may be interrupted due to a signal. Check the return value of <code>write</code> to implement <code>write_all</code> that will repeatedly call <code>write</code> with any remaining data. If <code>write</code> returns -1 then immediately return -1 unless the <code>errno</code> is <code>EINTR</code> - in which case repeat the last <code>write</code> attempt. You will need to use pointer arithmetic.</p>

<h2>Q 2.2</h2>
<p>Implement a multithreaded TCP server that listens on port 2000. Each thread should read 128 bytes from the client file descriptor and echo it back to the client, before closing the connection and ending the thread.</p>
<h2>Q 2.3</h2>
<p>Implement a UDP server that listens on port 2000. Reserve a buffer of 200 bytes. Listen for an arriving packet. Valid packets are 200 bytes or less and start with four bytes 0x65 0x66 0x67 0x68. Ignore invalid packets. For valid packets add the value of the fifth byte as an unsigned value to a running total and print the total so far. If the running total is greater than 255 then exit.</p>
